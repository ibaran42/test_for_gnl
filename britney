Baby, can not you see
I'm calling
A guy like you
Should wear a warning
It's dangerous
I'm fallin'

There's no escape
I can not wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm lovin 'it

Too high
Can not come down
Losing my head
Spinning' round and 'round
Do you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
you're toxic
I'm slipping under
With a taste of poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Do not you know that you re toxic
And I love what you do
Do not you know That you're toxic

It's getting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high
Can not come down
It's in the air
And it's all around
Can you feel me now

With a taste of your lips
I'm on a ride
You're toxic
I'm slipping under
With a taste of poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Do not you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do You do
not know that you're toxic

Do not you know that you're toxic

With a tast of your lips
I 'm we ride
you're toxic
I'm slipping under
With a taste of poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Do not you know That you' re toxic

Intoxicate me now
With your lovin 'now
I think I'm ready now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I'm ready now
